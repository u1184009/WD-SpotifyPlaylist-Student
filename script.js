  /* =====================================================
     DEV TEAMS — STEP 5: Listening Mode Logic
     (Your instructor didn't demo this one live — here's
     everything you need to figure it out as a team.)

     🟦 THIS IS THE SAME PATTERN AS A DIFFICULTY MODE.
     In your charity: water game, "Easy / Normal / Hard"
     will change things like time limits, win conditions,
     or how many drops the player needs to collect. The
     shape of the code is identical to what you'll write
     below — only the names change.

     WHAT THIS STEP NEEDS TO DO:
     Look at #mode-selector in index.html. It has two
     options: value="quickPlay" and value="fullSession".
     - "Quick Play" should use only the FIRST 3 songs from
       allSongs.
       (Hint: arrays have a .slice(start, end) method.)
     - "Full Session" should use ALL the songs in allSongs,
       bonus track included.

     WORKED MINI-EXAMPLE (same shape, different scenario):
       let lives;
       if (difficulty === "easy") {
         lives = 5;
       } else if (difficulty === "hard") {
         lives = 1;
       }
     Notice: one variable declared, then ASSIGNED a
     different value depending on the condition. You need
     a variable called `songs` that gets assigned the same
     way, based on `mode`.

     🤔 GUIDING QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM:
     If you added a third mode (e.g. "shuffleMode"), what
     would you add — another `else if`? What should it set
     `songs` to? Talk through it before you code your
     game's difficulty modes.

     YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
     1. Get the selected mode from modeSelector.value
     2. Declare a `songs` variable
     3. Write an if / else if that assigns `songs` based on
        the mode
     ===================================================== */
    const songMode = modeSelector.value;
    const songs = allSongs;

    console.log("Mode selected: ", songMode);
    if(songMode == "quickPlay"){
      songs = allSongs.slice(0, 2);
    }else if(songMode =="fullSession"){
      songs = allSongs;
    } 

    console.log(songs);


  /* =====================================================
     DEV TEAMS — STEP 6: Conditional Feedback
     (Also not demoed live — read closely before building
     your own win/lose message.)

     🟦 SAME PATTERN as a "You Win!" / "Try Again" message
     in your game: a conditional that changes BOTH the TEXT
     and the STYLE (CSS class) of one element, based on a
     condition.

     WHAT THIS STEP NEEDS TO DO:
     - Clear the previous playlist: container.innerHTML = ""
     - Reset songsRemovedCount to 0 and clear milestone text
       (so a fresh playlist starts its milestone count over)
     - Check if `songs.length === 0`:
         - If true: set feedback.textContent to a "no songs
           found" message, and feedback.className to
           "feedback-box error"
         - If false: set feedback.textContent to a message
           that includes how many songs loaded (look at the
           .feedback-box element in index.html for styling
           hooks), and feedback.className to
           "feedback-box success"

     WORKED MINI-EXAMPLE (same shape, different scenario):
       if (dropsCollected >= goal) {
         message.textContent = "You win!";
         message.className = "feedback-box success";
       } else {
         message.textContent = "Try again!";
         message.className = "feedback-box error";
       }
     Notice: TWO things change together inside each branch —
     the text AND the class. That's the pattern to copy.

     🤔 GUIDING QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM:
     What condition will YOUR game check — a score, a timer
     running out, a number of drops collected? What are the
     two things (text + class) that should change in each
     branch?

     ===================================================== */



  /* =====================================================
     DEV TEAMS — STEP 7: The Loop (⭐⭐⭐ MOST IMPORTANT!)

     WHAT THIS STEP NEEDS TO DO:
     Loop through your `songs` array (try .forEach) so that
     Steps 8 and 9 run once per song.

     🤔 GUIDING QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM:
     What two things does .forEach give you access to
     inside its callback function? You'll need at least one
     of them for Step 8.

     YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
     ===================================================== */



    /* =====================================================
       DEV TEAMS — STEP 8: Create and Display DOM Elements

       WHAT THIS STEP NEEDS TO DO (for each song):
       - Create a <div> with className "song-row"
       - Create an <img> — set its src to song.cover and
         alt to song.title
       - Add image fallback protection: if the image fails
         to load, set this.src to
         "https://placehold.co/60x60?text=Music"
         (Hint: img.onerror = function () { ... })
       - Create a <span> with the song title as its text
       - Create a <span> with className "remove-hint" and
         text "click to remove"
       - Append the img and both spans to the row, then
         append the row to `container`

       🤔 GUIDING QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM:
       Which DOM method creates a new element? Which method
       puts a child element inside a parent element?

    /* =====================================================
       DEV TEAMS — STEP 9: DOM Element Removal on Click
       🟦 DIRECT PRACTICE for your game's "DOM Element
       change/add/remove" requirement. This is the EXACT
       pattern you'll use to make a drop disappear when a
       player clicks it.

       WHAT THIS STEP NEEDS TO DO:
       - Add a "click" event listener to the row you just
         built
       - On click: add the CSS class "removing" to the row
         (check styles.css — this triggers a fade/slide
         transition)
       - After a short delay (try setTimeout, ~200ms to
         match the CSS transition), actually remove the row
         from the DOM (Hint: element.remove())
       - Increment songsRemovedCount
       - Call updateMilestone() (you'll write this in Step 10)

       🤔 GUIDING QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM:
       Why do we add a class AND wait, instead of just
       calling .remove() immediately? What would the user
       see if we skipped the delay?

       YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
       ===================================================== */



  // (Make sure your Step 7 loop closes here.)


  /* =====================================================
     DEV TEAMS — STEP 10: Milestone Tracking (Bonus pattern)
     🟦 DIRECT PRACTICE for the optional "Track and Display
     Milestones" bonus — an array of milestone objects
     checked with a conditional, just like you'd use to
     celebrate a player hitting 5, 10, or 20 drops collected.

     WHAT THIS STEP NEEDS TO DO:
     - Write a function called updateMilestone()
     - Inside it, create an array of milestone objects, each
       with a `count` and a `message`, e.g.:
         { count: 1, message: "🎵 First song cleared!" }
     - Loop through that array (try .forEach) and check: if
       songsRemovedCount matches a milestone's count, set
       milestone.textContent to that milestone's message

     🤔 GUIDING QUESTION FOR YOUR TEAM:
     What milestone counts make sense for YOUR game? If a
     player can collect a maximum of 10 drops, what are 2-3
     meaningful checkpoints worth celebrating along the way?
